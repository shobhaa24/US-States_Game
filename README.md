# US-States_Game

This is UNITED STATES, Guess the states Game.


This program uses "pandas" package to extract the states names, x cordinates and y cordinates from the 50_states.csv file.
The player has to guess the states names in the box, and if he got it right then that particular state area gets filled with its name on the US-MAP.(the position handling is taken care by x and y cor)

If the player decides to forfeit the game in the middle, then the program creates a "misses_states.csv" file which has name of all the states that the player missed.
